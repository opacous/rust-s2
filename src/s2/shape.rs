/// of polygons.

/// Shape is defined as an interface in order to give clients control over the
/// underlying data representation. Sometimes an Shape does not have any data of
/// its own, but instead wraps some other type.
///
/// Shape operations are typically defined on a ShapeIndex rather than
/// individual shapes. An ShapeIndex is simply a collection of Shapes,

/// three edges (AB, CD, DE) grouped into two chains: (AB) and (CD, DE).
/// Similarly, an Shape representing 5 points would have 5 chains consisting
/// of one edge each.
